# Coffee-Production-Quality-Dashboard-Power-BI-SQL
☕ Coffee Production & Quality Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global coffee production & quality data using Power BI. What started as a data cleaning practice turned into a deep dive into 32M+ kg of coffee data across countries, exploring how processing methods, moisture levels, and defects influence coffee quality and production output.

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter by year, country, moisture content, and defects, instantly changing the story and uncovering insights.

🔍 Key Insights

🌍 Top Producer: Costa Rica → 49.12% of total production

⭐ Top Quality: Ethiopia → Average Quality Score = 86.0

🍯 Processing Method: Pulped Natural/Honey → Best quality (84.46)

💧 Moisture: 0.03 → Highest quality score (88.55)

❌ Defects: More defects = Lower quality (strong negative correlation)

💡 Why It Matters

These insights go beyond coffee — the same analytical methods can be applied to:

🌱 Agriculture – Optimize crop yields and quality

🚚 Supply Chain – Improve distribution efficiency

🏭 Manufacturing – Monitor defects vs. quality

🛒 Retail – Align quality & pricing strategy

👨‍💻 Tools & Techniques

Power BI – Dashboard Development & Storytelling

Excel – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data Transformation – Handling null values, formatting, filters

KPIs & Visuals – Bar charts, scatter plots, maps, and filters
